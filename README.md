This code is web scraping the "biggest events in USA history" from two different web pages, extracting the year and the event name, and then cleaning and aggregating the data into a pandas DataFrame before saving it as a CSV file.

To accomplish this task, the code uses several popular Python libraries. Here's a brief summary of each one and how it's used in the code:

BeautifulSoup: Used for web scraping, specifically to parse the HTML content of the web pages and extract the relevant data.

requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the web pages and retrieve their content.

re: Used to perform regular expression operations on the event names, specifically to replace dashes with spaces and split the year and event name.

pandas: Used to manipulate the data and convert it into a structured DataFrame that can be easily saved as a CSV file.

The code starts by defining two URLs for the web pages containing the data. It then loops through these URLs, retrieves the HTML content using the requests library, and passes it to BeautifulSoup to extract the relevant data (the year and event name).

Once the data is extracted, the code uses regular expressions to replace dashes with spaces and split the year and event name into separate columns. It then fixes some errors in the data (e.g., correcting the year for a particular event) and groups all the events that occurred in the same year into a single row.

Finally, the code saves the data as a CSV file and then reads it back in to print it to the console.
